# SwiftData Tutorial

## Based off <a href="https://medium.com/@jpmtech">Chase on Medium.com</a>

This project is based off Chase's Medium.com articles related to SwiftData. They create an iOS app that retrieves data from an API and stores the information in a local SwiftData table for offline viewing.

### Active Branch: Intro

<p>This branch started based off Chase's Medium.com introduction to SwiftData article but quickly morphed. The basic concepts covered in Chase's article are still present (SwiftData backend, buttons to add and delete data, etc). However, the overall structure has been updated to include additional formatting and functionality.</p>
